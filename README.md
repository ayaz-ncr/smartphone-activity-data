# read the activity labels data, give descriptive column names and convert activity_id from numeric to factor

# read the features data, give descriptive column names

# read the subject train data, give descriptive column names and convert subject_id from numeric to factor

# read the X_train data, give descriptive column names

# read the y_train data, give descriptive column names and convert activity_id from numeric to factor

# read the subject_test data, give descriptive column names and convert subject_id from numeric to factor

# read the X_test data, give descriptive column names

# read the y_test data, give descriptive column names and convert activity_id from numeric to factor

# combine (column bind) subject_train, X_train, y_train data to get training data - activity, subject and all variables in one data set

# combine (column bind) subject_test, X_test, y_test data to get test_data - activity, subject and all variables in one data set

# combine (row bind) training and test data to get full_data in a single dataset

# merge activity labels with full data obtained in last step to display activity name instead of activity id

# filter the dataset to include only mean and std measurements

# read data into a data table, get average of each variable by activity and subject

# write the data table to a txt file (tidy_data.txt)

# check the tidy data txt file validity by reading back into data table
